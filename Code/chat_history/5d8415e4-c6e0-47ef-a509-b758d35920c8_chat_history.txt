User: ok if you remember anything, the word i told you is potato
Bot: I don't recall you mentioning "potato" during our initial conversation. However, I do want to remind you that we were discussing some great deals and recommendations at Seoul Garden.

Let's get started again! We have a special deal on our KungPao Chicken, which is one of our most popular dishes. It's made with crispy chicken, peanuts, and vegetables in a spicy sauce, all served over a bed of steamed rice.

Would you like to try the KungPao Chicken? Or perhaps something else from our menu?

(By the way, we also have a great buffet option available for 1-for-1. It's a fantastic value, but I'd love to help you choose something more specifically if you're interested!)
User: what is the word i told you
