Bot: I couldn't find any information on a person named Jun Hao being referred to as the "Lazy Boy." It's possible that you may be thinking of a different person or character.

However, I do know of a popular Chinese manga and anime series called "The Breaker" (also known as "Bakuman") which features a character named Jun-hao Lee. In this series, Jun-hao is actually depicted as an extremely talented artist and creator, not lazy at all!

If you could provide more context or clarify who or what you are referring to as the "Lazy Boy," I'd be happy to try and help further!
