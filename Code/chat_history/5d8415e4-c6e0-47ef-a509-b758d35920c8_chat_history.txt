User: ok if you remember anything, the word i told you is potato
Bot: I don't recall you mentioning "potato" during our initial conversation. However, I do want to remind you that we were discussing some great deals and recommendations at Seoul Garden.

Let's get started again! We have a special deal on our KungPao Chicken, which is one of our most popular dishes. It's made with crispy chicken, peanuts, and vegetables in a spicy sauce, all served over a bed of steamed rice.
