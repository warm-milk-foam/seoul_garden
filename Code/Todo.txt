Todo list:
1) Fix the chat system
2) Implement a log out system
3) Make the ordering interactive instead of just a static menu
-Including making a function to send the orders to the order history of account
-And add more menu items to it
4) When the chat system is finished, make it so that the AI can have access to the order history and previous info told to it by the user
5) Make it so when an account is made, recommendations are automatically written to it as well

Extra:
1) Make a chat history
2) Get more flavour text to mark up the home page

Extra: (but hard)
1) Implement a feedback system
-Which can affect the chatbot recommendation
2) Implement more models, which the user can choose
